# Responsive Navbar Project

This project aims to create a responsive navbar for websites. The navbar will adapt and adjust its layout based on different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience across various devices.

## Features

- Responsive design: The navbar will automatically adjust its layout to fit different screen sizes, ensuring it remains accessible and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Dropdown menu: The navbar will include a dropdown menu that can display additional navigation options when clicked or tapped.
- Hamburger menu: On smaller screens, a hamburger menu icon will be displayed, allowing users to expand and collapse the navigation menu.
- Customizable styles: The navbar's appearance and styling can be easily customized to match the overall design of the website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the navbar and its elements will be implemented using HTML.
- CSS: Styling and layout adjustments will be done using CSS, including media queries for responsiveness.
